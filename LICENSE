Aria2代码的GPL感染问题

如果你将本项目直接打包为鸿蒙应用，则整个项目受到 entry/libs/arm64-v8a/libaria2.so
文件的感染成为 GPLv2 许可项目。但只要删除 entry/libs 里的所有二进制，项目的其余部分
就可以作为公有领域代码使用。

GPL infection problem of Aria2 code

If you package this project directly as a HarmonyOS application, the entire 
project will be infected by the entry/libs/arm64-v8a/libaria2.so file and 
become a GPLv2 licensed project.

However, if you delete all binaries in entry/libs folder, the rest of
the project can be used as public domain code.
